## Paste Images In Webp - configuration

* `context_menu_entry` - Add an entry to the editor context menu
* `shortcut` - Define a keyboard shortcut for pasting images as webp
* `show_editor_button` - Add a button to the editor toolbar
* `width` - Desired width
* `height` - Desired height

If one of the dimensions is set to `0`, images will be resized
preserving the aspect ratio.
If both `wdith` and `height` are `0`, no resizing is performed (not recommended).
